# fast-automata-with-python
Vectorized implementation of cellular automata in python. Uses numpy for CPU and (optionally) cupy for GPU. 
1D implements basics cellular automata with user defined rule.
2D implements Game Of Life. Patterns can be placed on the initial state.

Main function that performs one iteration -- `step`, is less than 10 lines.
